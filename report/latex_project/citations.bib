abstract="Image compression is a technique for reducing the size of the data in form of images to enhance storage and transmission of the images in a better manner. Since images with large size require complex systems and more storage it leads to increased complexity in handling the data. To overcome such problems image compression techniques are available in form of lossy as well as lossless techniques. The paper addresses the lossy image compression technique by utilizing the singular value decomposition method for compression images with large size. This method splits the images into set of components which are linearly independent. Eigen values of the images and partitioning of images in form of blocks is used for image compression. Singular value decomposition can be directly applied for compressing images but due to certain disadvantages it is used along with Eigen vectors and portioning hence giving much netter results.",
